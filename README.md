### 1. Sign Language to Audio:

 - Firstly create a virtual python environment and run the jupyter notebooks.
 - Open the first jupyter notebook named as 'Image Collection'.
 - Edit the labels section to increase the vocabulary of your model. The words mentioned in the labels dictionary will be the ones which will be detected by the model.
